# Album_Review_Web_App-MI361_Final
 Utilizing Python and the Flask library, this web application allows users to search for albums and leave reviews. 
 It has a rudimentary login system as well, but it was never fully implemented as this was for an IT class final and I had already gone way beyond the requirements, and there was no time to implement that feature fully. 
 Docker was used to create a container that was then hosted on Microsoft Azure containerization services. 
 The album data was accessed using the Musicbrainz API for Python. Jinja2 HTML templates were utilized to allow search results to generate as HTML Elements.
